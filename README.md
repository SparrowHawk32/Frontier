# Frontier
Frontier is a modern emulator front end for Windows (C#) with Android support planned. It offers sleek UI, smart game library management, multi-emulator support, and deep customization. Built for retro gaming fans who want speed, flexibility, and style. Let me know if you'd like a tagline or logo idea next!
